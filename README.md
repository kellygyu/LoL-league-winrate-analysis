## Introduction
League of Legends is a game focused on champion gameplay and team communication. With each patch bringing in new champions, game metas, and champion debuffs/buffs, we can only wonder if banning broken champions will benefit team win rates. In this project, we will explore whether the top most banned champions truly has a higher win rate distribution compared to the rest of the champion pools.
